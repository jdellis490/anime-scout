# Anime Scout

## Description
This app uses both Jikan API and YouTube APIs to fetch data on an anime that is typed into the search bar. The user will be able to search an anime and get various titles of the searched anime displayed on cards on the left side of the page. The selected card that's displayed will give a full title, description, and score. The trailer displayed appears based on the initial title that was input into the search.

## Installation

It's deployed [here](https://jdellis490.github.io/anime-scout/) and can be used the user's default browswer.

## Usage

To use, one must simply type in an anime and like a search engine they will get results based on the title that was searched.
This is what the application looks like:
